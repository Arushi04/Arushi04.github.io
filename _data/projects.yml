- name: Prediction of Fatality in COVID-19 Patients
  gh_user: Arushi04
  repo: COVID-19-Analysis

  desc: This project covers exploratory and confirmatory data analysis to explore relationships between different underlying factors related to the pandemic. I have build a machine learning model that predicts the fatality of the patients and have also analyzed and predicted the progress of COVID-19 in USA using SIR model. The aim of this prediction is to facilitate the healthcare establishments to prioritize patients for specialized medical attention, at an early stage.

- name: Image Classification
  gh_user: Arushi04
  repo: ImageClassification
  img: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tzuehlke/jekyll-uno-timeline/master/screenshot-overview.png
  desc: This image classification has been done on CIFAR10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks.

- name: Document ranking using vector-space models and language models
  gh_user: Arushi04
  repo: Information-Retrieval
  img: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tzuehlke/jekyll-uno-timeline/master/screenshot-overview.png
  desc: This project focuses on documents and query matching using vector space models, language models and machine learning models. Stores the document on elastic search and retrieves only the topmost ranking documents based on the query. I have also written the script to evaluate the performace for document retrieval for each query.

- name: Classification of Names using character level LSTM model
  gh_user: Arushi04
  repo: character-level-RNN
