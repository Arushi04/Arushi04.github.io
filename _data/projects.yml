  desc: This project covers exploratory and confirmatory data analysis to explore relationships between different underlying factors related to the pandemic. I have build a machine learning model that predicts the fatality of the patients and have also analyzed and predicted the progress of COVID-19 in USA using SIR model. The aim of this prediction is to facilitate the healthcare establishments to prioritize patients for specialized medical attention, at an early stage.

  desc: This project focuses on documents and query matching using vector space models, language models and machine learning models. Stores the document on elastic search and retrieves only the topmost ranking documents based on the query. I have also written the script to evaluate the performace for document retrieval for each query.

- name: Name Classification using character level LSTM model
