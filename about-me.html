<body>
<p>
	My name is Arushi Sharma. I am pursuing <strong> Masters in Data Science </strong> from Northeastern University, Boston.
	I am currently working as a <strong>Research Assistant</strong> at NEU doing research to figure out whether copy-cats/imitators of designers encourage or discourage innovation.
	<br/>
	My courses at Northeastern includes Mathematics(Linear ALgebra, Probability), Statistics, Data Mining & Warehousing, Information Retrieval and Machine Learning. 
	<br/>

	I have <strong>6 years of industry experience</strong> working with for IBM, Accenture and Bridgei2i Analytics Solutions in multiple domains (Financial, Telecom, Insurance and technology).
	And have majorly worked in python building data pipelines, creating and automating cloud infrastructure and deploying machine learning models.
	<br/>
	My interest area is <strong>Deep Learning and NLP. </strong>
	<br/>
	In my leisure time, I love to read (anything interesting, futuristic or inspirational) and go on hikes. I also love to play badminton and chess.
