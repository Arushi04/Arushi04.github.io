<p> This project covers exploratory and confirmatory data analysis to explore relationships between different underlying factors related to the pandemic. We have analyzed and predicted the progress of COVID-19 in USA using SIR model and have build a model that predicts the fatality of the patients. The aim of this prediction is to facilitate the healthcare establishments to prioritize patients for specialized medical attention, at an early stage.</p>
