My name is Arushi Sharma. I am a pursuing Masters in Data Science from Northeastern University, Boston. <br/>

I have worked in the software industry for 6 years for IBM, Accenture and Bridgei2i Analytics Solutions that helped me gain a broad perspective in different domains (Financial, Telecom, Insurance and product-based). <br/  

I have majorly worked in building data pipelines, creating cloud infrastructure, deployment machine learning models and automation. My current projects are in Machine Learning, Computer vision and NLP. <br/

In my leisure time, I love to read (anything interesting, futuristic or inspirational) and go on hikes. I also love to play badminton and chess.

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
