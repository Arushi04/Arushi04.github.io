<p>
	My name is Arushi Sharma. I am pursuing Masters in Data Science from Northeastern University, Boston.
	I am currently working as a Research Assistant at NEU doing research to figure out whether copy-cats/imitators of designers encourage or discourage innovation.
	<br/>
	My courses at Northeastern includes Mathematics(Linear ALgebra, Probability), Statistics, Data Mining & Warehousing, Information Retrieval and Machine Learning. 
	<br/>

	I have worked in the software industry for 6 years for IBM, Accenture and Bridgei2i Analytics Solutions in multiple domains (Financial, Telecom, Insurance and technology).
	And have majorly worked in python building data pipelines, creating and automating cloud infrastructure and deploying machine learning models.
	<br/>
	My interest area is Deep Learning, trying to explore both text and images.
	<br/>
	In my leisure time, I love to read (anything interesting, futuristic or inspirational) and go on hikes. I also love to play badminton and chess.
